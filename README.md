# Document Classification


## Description

The objective of this project is to create and compare text-based
classification models. Using a dataset of labeled documents, the models
will be used to classify un-labeled documents into one of two
categories.

## Project Organization

- `/code` Scripts with prefixes (e.g., `01_import-data.py`,
  `02_clean-data.py`) and functions in `/code/src`.
- `/data` Simulated and real data, the latter not pushed.
- `/figures` PNG images and plots.
- `/output` Output from model runs, not pushed.
- `/presentations` Presentation slides.
- `/private` A catch-all folder for miscellaneous files, not pushed.
- `/venv` Project library.
- `/writing` Case studies and the paper.
- `requirements.txt` Information on the reproducible environment.

## Reproducible Environment

Every package you install lives in your system library, accessible to
all projects. However, packages change. Add a reproducible environment
by creating a project library using venv.
